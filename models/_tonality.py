class Tonality:
    """
    Tonality of the song.

    Spotify's audio_analysis response provides numeric values for the key and the mode of the song.
    This class maps integers to the keys, assigns mode to the key and returns tonic (chord) of the song.
    E.g Am. You can access it as 'tonality' attribute of the AudioAnalysis class.


    :param key: represented by an integer.
                Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation.
                E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, 2 = D, and so on.
                If no key was detected, the value is -1.
                >= -1 <= 11

    :param key_confidence: from 0.0 to 1.0, represents the reliability of the key.
                           >= 0 <= 1

    :param mode: Indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track,
                 the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived.
                 Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0.

    :param mode_confidence: from 0.0 to 1.0, of the reliability of the mode.
                            >= 0 <= 1
